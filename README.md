# Cool Little Portfolio Website Thing
I'm making this website as like a little hub for some coding experiments and practice.

## Content

### Random Number Generator
Just a relatively simple random number generator made with JavaScript. Really basic at the moment but I'm hoping to
incorperate more CSS some animations to make it look nice. It would be nice if I could get slot-machine-like spinning
animation to play that stops on the newly generated number.

### English to Piglatin Translator
Self-explanatory, this page translates english text input to piglatin and outputs it onto the page.

## Dev Logs
### 9/30/2022
As of now, my biggest priority is making the website responsive with different screen sizes.
Right now I'm experimenting with all the media queries in the development branch. Once I find
it acceptable I'll push the changes from development to the master
branch.
